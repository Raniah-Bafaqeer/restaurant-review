   2. In a terminal, change the root directory into the project root folder to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer by using Python.
   3. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. then launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:

      Python 2.x:  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
      Python 3.x:  `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
